Homework 1

Consider the following data with the prediction column being `Will_Buy_Car`. Using `Age`, `Gender`,`Car_Ownership` as input columns for a Decision tree, calculate the following :

| Age | Gender | Car_Ownership | Will_Buy_Car |
|-----|--------|--------------|--------------|
|  50 |      M |          Yes |          Yes |
|  50 |      M |           No |           No |
|  50 |      M |          Yes |          Yes |
|  30 |      M |           No |           No |
|  30 |      M |          Yes |          Yes |
|  10 |      M |           No |           No |
|  10 |      M |           No |           No |
|  10 |      M |          Yes |           No |


Question 1 (30)

- At root node, what is the Information Gain if we split by `Age`, `Gender`,`Car_Ownership` respectively ? 

- Which column is used to make the first split ?


- Once trained, What will be the output on a new sample with Age = 50, Car_Ownership = Yes ,Gender = M ? Can you train the same tree without Gender column , why or why not ?
